A function in Python is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. Functions help organize code, reduce redundancy, and make programs easier to maintain.
A function is defined using the def keyword.
Functions are called by their name followed by parentheses.
Parameters allow functions to accept inputs.
Arguments can be hard-coded or user input.
****Arbitrary Arguments (*args)****
  Using *args lets a function accept any number of arguments, stored as a tuple.
**Default (Keyword) Arguments**
  If no arguments are passed, default values are used.
  If arguments are provided, they override the defaults.
****Keyword Arguments (**kwargs)****
  Using **kwargs allows passing key-value pairs, which are treated like a dictionary.
**Functions with Iterables**
  Functions can take lists (or other iterables) as arguments.
  Here, the function iterates over a list of favorite foods and prints each item.
**Return Statement**
  The return statement sends back a value to the caller.
  Returned values can be stored in variables or used in expressions.
**Recursion**
  Recursion means a function calls itself.
  Must have a base condition to avoid infinite loops.
**Functions Returning Collections**
  Functions can return lists, dictionaries, or other data structures.
