In Python, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of structuring code so you model real-world entities as objects that have attributes (data) and methods (behavior).
Here are the main OOP concepts in Python explained:

**1. Class and Object**

Class: A blueprint for creating objects (defines attributes and methods).

Object: An instance of a class.

**2. Encapsulation**

Bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data in a single unit (class).

Restricts direct access to some attributes using private (__) or protected (_) variables.

**3. Abstraction**

Hides complex implementation details, exposing only the necessary parts.

In Python, abstraction can be achieved using abstract base classes from the abc module.

**4. Inheritance**

A class can inherit properties and methods from another class, promoting reusability.

**5. Polymorphism**

The same method name can have different implementations depending on the object.

Achieved through method overriding or operator overloading.
